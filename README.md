# bank-quiz
Making a quiz for the lady. Basic HTML/CSS/JS at this point, but looking to expand.

# Status

At present, the quiz is functional. 

- Questions have to be answered; you can't skip past an unanswered question.
- Visual feedback on an answered question.
- Possible to increase number of questions without excess difficulty, as long as you follow the same naming conventions (id/class attr).

## Limitations

There are a few issues with the project as it currently stands.

- It's kind of ugly. At least, I think so.
- Questions *have* to have four answers, or it doesn't work.
- It's probably not very tight javascript.
